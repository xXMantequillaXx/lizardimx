## 7. Design System

### Aesthetic Direction
**"Dark Base + Colorful Accents"** — Matching the gecko logo personality

### Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Background Primary** | Rich Black | `#0A0A0A` | Main background |
| **Background Secondary** | Charcoal | `#141414` | Cards, sections |
| **Background Tertiary** | Dark Gray | `#1E1E1E` | Elevated elements |
| **Text Primary** | Off-White | `#F5F5F5` | Headlines, body |
| **Text Secondary** | Cool Gray | `#A0A0A0` | Captions, metadata |
| **Accent 1** | Electric Cyan | `#00D9FF` | Primary CTAs, links |
| **Accent 2** | Hot Magenta | `#FF3CAC` | Highlights, hovers |
| **Accent 3** | Lime Green | `#39FF14` | Success states, accents |
| **Accent 4** | Vibrant Orange | `#FF6B35` | Warnings, emphasis |
| **Accent 5** | Royal Purple | `#7B2CBF` | Special elements |

### Gradient Options
- **Primary Gradient:** Cyan → Magenta (`#00D9FF` → `#FF3CAC`)
- **Secondary Gradient:** Green → Cyan (`#39FF14` → `#00D9FF`)
- **Warm Gradient:** Orange → Magenta (`#FF6B35` → `#FF3CAC`)

*Use gradients sparingly for CTAs, section dividers, or hover states*

### Typography

| Role | Font Suggestion | Fallback |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Display/Headlines** | Space Grotesk, Clash Display, or Cabinet Grotesk | system-ui |
| **Body Text** | Plus Jakarta Sans, DM Sans | system-ui |
| **Code/Monospace** | JetBrains Mono, Fira Code | monospace |

*Note: Final font selection should avoid overused AI-aesthetic fonts. Consider Satoshi, General Sans, or Manrope as alternatives.*

### Visual Elements
- **Cards:** Subtle glassmorphism or soft borders on dark backgrounds
- **Icons:** Geometric/linear style to match logo
- **Imagery:** Dark-toned, high-contrast photography or abstract geometric art
- **Effects:** Subtle grain texture, gradient meshes for depth

### Animation Principles
Motion should feel like surveillance systems and intelligence dashboards — purposeful, never decorative.

| Animation Type | Duration | Use Case |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Fast interactions** | 150-250ms | Hovers, clicks, toggles |
| **Medium transitions** | 300-500ms | Reveals, state changes |
| **Slow ambient** | 3-8s | Background loops, pulses |

**MVP Animations (CSS only):**
- Scanning line across hero (8s loop, 30% opacity)
- Pulsing glow on logo/CTAs (4s loop)
- Button hover scan effect (0.5s)
- Card hover lift + glow (0.3s)
- Navigation underline grow (0.3s)
- Loading bars (1s loop)

**Phase 2 Enhancements:**
- Typing effect for headlines
- Grid pulse backgrounds
- Counter/ticker animations

**Phase 3 Polish:**
- Lottie logo reveal animation
- Video loop backgrounds (Runway ML)
- Advanced SVG animations

**Accessibility:** Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion` with static fallbacks.

### Layout Principles
- **Generous whitespace** (or "dark space" in this case)
- **Asymmetric compositions** where appropriate
- **Content-first hierarchy**
- **Mobile-responsive from the start**
- **Restrained complexity** — sophisticated but not overwhelming

### Inspiration Reference
- Mercalitica.mx (for consistency in professional feel)
- den.cool (for creativity, but more restrained)
- Dark mode SaaS sites (Vercel, Linear, Raycast)
